Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

A: When I collaborate with others, other people can easily access my
repository from their computer if we use remote repository.

Besides, storing files in remote repository acts as a back up when
your own machine is malfunctioning.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: There may be some changes from the remote repository that we don't
want to merge into our local repository. Manually pull changes adds
control to the merging process.
