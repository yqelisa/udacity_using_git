Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

A: When I collaborate with others, other people can easily access my
repository from their computer if we use remote repository.

Besides, storing files in remote repository acts as a back up when
your own machine is malfunctioning.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: There may be some changes from the remote repository that we don't
want to merge into our local repository. Manually pull changes adds
control to the merging process.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

A: Forking is for copying from the source repository and getting updated
contents as the source repository. Cloning is for pulling content from
remote repository to your local repository. Branches is a concept when
you want to conduct version control and you can use different Branches
to store different versions of a group of scripts.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?

A: So we can develop in a synced environment and comply with the master
branch. When stored locally, we don't need to rely on internet connection
when we want to merge the branches.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

A: We can collaborate using Google Doc, which is a web application that shares
content synchronously. But without Git or Github, it's going to be harder to do
that.
