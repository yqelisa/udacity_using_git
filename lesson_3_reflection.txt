Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful
in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

A: We can create a branch for a major change, and make all
the commits that contribute to this change to the same
branch. In this way we'll see how different game plans result
in different outcomes of the project.


Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

A: Diagrams helps me understand the sequence of commits, and
which commits are on the same branch. It provides a better logical
structure of the program.


Q: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

A: The result is that changes from the merged branch will be introduced
into the checked-out branch. We represent the changes using
asteroids and the existing contents in sequence to make distinction
of what's changed and what are not.
