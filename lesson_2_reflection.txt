Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?

A: Before every commit, we can check the staging area to see
how many files are changed. If there are more than one file
being changed, then it implies the change would be more than
1 logical change.

staging area adds one file to the commit at a time.
it provides a buffer to make mistakes before making the commit.
it also allows you to only add the files you want to commit.
